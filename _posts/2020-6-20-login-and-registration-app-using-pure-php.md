title: "Tutorial Series #1: Login and registration app using pure PHP"
---

Greetings to anyone who's reading this. I'm starting a tutorial series on PHP and since this is the first scripting language that plunged me into the world of web development and programming in general, I will be writing more content about PHP. This is also my first blog and I would greatly apprecate any feedback and especially criticism on my work.

Below are the links to the tutorial series (3 parts):

1. **<a href="https://thepinoyprogrammer.github.io/login-and-registration-app-using-pure-php-part-1-registration">Login and registration app using pure PHP - Part 1: Registration</a>**
2. **<a href="https://thepinoyprogrammer.github.io/login-and-registration-app-using-pure-php-part-2-handling-user-data">Login and registration app using pure PHP - Part 2: Handling user data</a>**
3. **Login and registration app using pure PHP - Part 3: Login**

I haven't added a comment section on my blog yet, in the meantime please contact me through email: <a href="mailto:mbuyco@protonmail.com">mbuyco@protonmail.com</a>. If you'd like me to work on more content like this, I could use a <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/pinoyprogrammer">cup of coffee or two</a> :)
